# Sequence_Detector_Mealy_0011
A Mealy Machine Sequence Detector is Implemented using Verilog. The sequence to be detected is 0011.

# Overview
The code consists of two modules, a clock divider module (Frequency_Divider) and a Mealy state machine module (top_Seq_Det_Mealy_0011).
The clock divider module divides the input clock of 100MHz frequency into a low frequency output (1 Hz). The Mealy state machine module detects a specific sequence of input (0011) and generates an output accordingly. The state machine has four states (A, B, C, and D) and transitions between them based on the input w.

# Inputs

**clock_in:** input clock signal with a frequency of 100MHz.

**w:** input sequence for the Mealy state machine.

**Resetn:** active low reset signal for the Mealy state machine.

# Outputs

**clock_out:** low-frequency clock signal (1 Hz) generated by the clock divider module.

**z:** output signal generated by the Mealy state machine according to the detected sequence.

# Modules

**Frequency_Divider:**
This module takes the clock_in signal as input and generates a low-frequency clock_out signal as output. It divides the input clock signal by a factor of 50000000 to obtain a 1 Hz output signal.

**top_Seq_Det_Mealy_0011:**
This module implements the Mealy state machine that detects the input sequence '0011'. It takes three inputs, namely clock_in, w, and Resetn. It generates two outputs, namely z and clk1. This module has four states (A, B, C, and D) and transitions between them based on the input w. The output z is generated based on the detected sequence, and the output clk1 is generated by connecting the clock_in signal to the clock divider module.

# Usage
To use this code, follow the steps below:

- Copy the code to a file named top_Seq_Det_Mealy_0011.v
- Include the Frequency_Divider module in the top_Seq_Det_Mealy_0011 module.
- Instantiate the top_Seq_Det_Mealy_0011 module in the main program or testbench.
- Provide the necessary inputs to the module, such as clock_in, w, and Resetn.

# Assumptions
This code assumes that the input clock signal has a frequency of 100MHz and the input sequence w is a binary signal.
